This project is the voice server part of a messenger, which was implemented as a university project in the second semester in the advanced programming course. This project is implemented using C# and WPF language. What this project does is that it receives a message in the form of voice from a client and sends it to the destination client that has its IP and port. The interesting thing is that if the destination client was offline, the server will send the message again when the destination client is online. Socket programming has been used to implement these concepts.
